# Aragon Network

The [Aragon Network](https://aragon.org/network) is the world's first digital jurisdiction, and is itself operated as a decentralized organization using Aragon. It was [first described](https://blog.aragon.org/introducing-the-aragon-network-20b998e2caba/) in the Aragon Network whitepaper, the [first version](https://github.com/aragon/whitepaper/tree/v1) of which was released to the public on April 14, 2017.

The Aragon Network is governed by Aragon Network Token (ANT) holders subject to the [Aragon Governance Process](governance/index.md). Through the governance process, ANT holders continually improve the functioning of the Network and allocate funds to support the development of the Network. The first vote ever held by the Aragon Network on the Ethereum mainnet was [using the Survey app](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-launches-survey-app-on-mainnet-ed5eefeb66f5/), and started on May 31, 2018. Later that year, ANT holders [voted to approve](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-the-agp-1-vote/) AGP-1: The Aragon Governance Proposal Process.

At AraCon 2019, Aragon project co-founder and Aragon One CEO Luis Cuende [announced](https://youtu.be/oND8XJ-bvB8?t=389) that the Aragon Network would launch on the Ethereum mainnet by the end of 2019.
